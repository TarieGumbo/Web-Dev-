    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      This is a prototype webpage which i am using to learn about HTML and CSS.
      Of course the work will look rough since today(03/01/2023) is my first day
      learning the language so im basicaaly using the format that the guy is
      teaching me with
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-continue">It Continues</h2>
    <p>
      I'm quite seriously just typing whatever comes to mind so it will without
      a doubt look rough when it finally trasnaltes to an actual web page. I
      cant wait until im making fully funtcional and professional webpages. Just
      you wait. Its gonna be epic!
