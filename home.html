    <h1>My Reasons Why</h1>
    <div id="poetry">
      <p>
        It took me a very long time to discover myself in a way that i can
        express myself, my thoughts and visions. Is there anyone reading this?
        Can i really reach you with my words ? Do i make a difference? That
        remains a questions, but i like to try. And this is why: Along the way i
        found out what works and what doesnt work for me. I know my low points,
        my weaknesses and i know better than anyone how i work. As i aways say,
        and it is and remains a cliche, treating another as you would like to be
        treated yourself is the key. Unfortunately , i cannot control how
        someone else thinks, how they treat me and in what situtations that has
        brought me. A lot has happened so that i have lost hope often enough,
        confidence has damaged and i have often stood on the brink of collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet with time and awareness i have found my way back and i have kept my
        goal in mind. I want to show who i am, not how someone else presents me
        or treats me. I want to share how i think and how things can be
        improved, i want to help those who have experienced the same thing, I
        want to help make this world a better place, at least i want to try.
      </p>
      <p class="state">
        When i was i a worse state, it always something that was missing.
        Someone who understood me, who felt what i felt, who could articluate
        what was going on inside of me, somene who could guide me through the
        search and name of all the chaos inside of me.But when that person was
        not there, i only had two options and i chose to fight. I wanted to
        discover who i was, what caused my thoughts, my questions and my
        emptiness, and how i could fill, name and express it, how i could find
        myself in the chaos and make the chaos in the world change. I went
        through a development and grwoth that i never envisaged until a few
        years ago.
      </p>
      <p class="introvert">
        I am an introvert, i am HSP (Highly sensitve Person), someone with an
        extra sense, i see, feel, and think deeply, insense and often. This has
        always been something that got in my way and what i am uncertain about,
        i feel more vulnerable, because when you feel an experience everything
        so intensly, it can cause you enormous damage. I learned my lessons in
        this and formed my vision and passion. I want to help others see and
        feel things can be different. Because it is possible as long you are
        willing to look at yourself with all pure and genuine intentions and to
        express this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>A Gentle Reminder</h2>
    <p class="gentle reminder">
      The truth is- genuine connection is ease. It is peace. When you find it
      you will know. You will feel seen. You will feel respected. At the end of
      the day, the human beings that surround you in this life should not
      exhaust you or hollow you out, or leave you feeling like you are hard to
      love. You should not have to play games, or beg for someone to care for
      you the way you have deeply shown up to care for them. Please do not
      romanticize the things in this life that hurt. You cannot love someone
      into loving you or bng ready or meeting their potential; you cannot close
      their hands around your heart if they are not willing to hold it
      themselves. You have to let them go. You have to focus on the people in
      your life who bring you back home to yourself. You have to focus on
      standing up for that kind of connection because it exists. It exists,
      Trust that it will find you.
    </p>
    <p class="reminder">
      It is often in your weakest moments that you have the opportunity to be
      the strongest. However, this does not mean putting on a brave face and
      pretending that the heaviness does not exist. No, instead this means
      sitting with your feelings and experiencing them as they are - letting
      them wash over you like rain. This means choosing to confront the voids,
      instead of filling them or numbing them or distracting yourslef from the
      fact that they exist. In an age of extreme stimulation, in an age where we
      can sweep our pain under the rug, and focus on everything outisde of
      ourselves that readily available and seeking our attention, it takes a lot
      of courage to face what hurts. To look it in the eyes, to gie it a name,
      to understand that you cannot outrun yourself forever. That is what makes
      it an act of strength. That is where the healing begins.
    </p>
    <p class="gentle">
      Stay open to this world. Stay open to this world because it is filled with
      human beings and experiences and feelings that wil deeply and beautifully
      grow you and inspire you and reind you that there is so much out therejust
      waiting to be discovered. All it takes is one chance encounter, one
      singlar moment in time, to completely change your life - to expand the way
      you see happiness, and hope; to crack your ehart open, to introduce it to
      levels of feeling and caring that you never knew existed. Yes, it is risky
      to be vulnerable, to be unguarded in this life: but it is far riskier to
      stay closed to all of the possibility that exists within it, to stay
      fortified and safe and tucked away from feeling. At the end of the day,
      you are here to risk your heart. You are here to connect. Please don't
      ever forget that.
    </p>

    <h3>Becoming</h3>
    <p>
      Your life is your own. I want you to read that sentence until it sinks all
      the way down insdie your gut and meets every last impulse that tells you
      to put your intuitio on pause , to place yourself second, to squeeze and
      bend and break into molds of what everyone else wants ou to be. Your life
      is your own. I want it to pass through your head so many times it slowly
      cleasrs out the debris of your fear. I want you to mediate on it until you
      realize that you are not too strange, you are not dfferent, you just have
      the courage to follow your own heart; you are not unworthy, you are just
      honest about the very natural, human experience of feeling unworthiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every person alive wishes to embody these very same forms of freedom. They
      are not judgin you, they are expressing the parts of themselves they've
      judged into silence. Your life is your own and it always will be. You must
      find the courage to claim it, or it will pass by you unatouchable- a
      glimmering, lost potential of all that could have been.
    </p>

      <h3>Put yourself into perspective</h3>
      <p>
        You do what you feel good about, which you think is the right thing you
        believe in and where you get your strength from. You do it for yourself,
        is that selfish? No, because you live your own life. As long as you do
        everything from your heart, your feeling and yurpassion, you are doing
        well. Your intentions are pure, beacuse as long as you make your own
        choices and act from your feeling, passion and compassion, you do not
        hurt anyone do you?
      </p>
      <p>
        In everything you do and in everything you say people can exress
        themslves angry, disappointed or jealous. Perharps this is because they
        are disappointed that you think of yourself for once, instead of putting
        yourself aside. Maybe it is because they would rather see you go down
        than you are doing well. And maybe they are scared, afraid they can not
        make the same choices or can not achiece the same as you.
