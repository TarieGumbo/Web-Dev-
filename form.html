        <em>
          This session is mostly about forms, which i didnt exactly feel excited
          about cause im more invested in the design part of the website. I
          wanna make it look aesthically pleasing so even if i do the form i
          want to be pleased just by looking at it. Hmm i know not cute but i
          said what i said. I have added comments to make it more
          understandable.

    <h2>About the webpage</h2>
    <p>
      The webpage contains information and details on how a form is. The html
      text used here are text, inputs, labels, select, placeholders, values. All
      of which allwo the user to input data. The labels make it easy to identify
      what the input is for while the text will identify what data needs to
      typed in as the input by the user.

      <ol>
        <li><b>Labels:</b> are used to identify what is the input type is </li>
        <li><b>Input:</b> was used to allow the user to input data</li>
        <li><b>Text:</b> This would imply what the user is typing in. (It would also act as a form of data validation just in case they type in number instead of text)</li>
        <li><b>Select:</b> was used for drop down lists</li>
        <li><b>Placeholder:</b> are used after id tags in the input places and they act as directors for the users to know what to type.</li>
      </ol>
