      <h2>My <small>Third</small> <em> Attempt</em></h2>
      <!--Small makes the word smaller; Em makes it italics-->
      <p>
        The initial attempt was the index.html which had the twitter handle and
        the second one was the one with the hyperlinks. This one has got a lot
        of the basics such as use of div tags, ordered and unordered lists. Im
        sure there's more that im going to add to this little paragraph that im
        typing. Oh yes there more data on br which is for breaking lines which
        is what I've down for the rest of this paragraph <br />
        <!--Br is used to make line breaks in the code -->The next would be hr
        which adds a horizontal line. I have used it just below the image to
        sort of break off the vibe of the webpage.The other thing would be a
        blockquote whoch is used to quote another website. Although iw ould like
        i was a bit fascinaed when it didnt actually check if the quote i placed
        was from the website.
      </p>
      <p style="color: burlywood">(I used pinterest for the quote)</p>
      <p>
        The work that i have learnt for all three attempst will de displayed by
        shortly below this little intro. This website/ page will contain the use
        of lists, div tags, span tags and whatever else I'll learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can refer to the first attempt was the tweet ( it will not be
        included here for the time being)
        <a href="tweet.html" target="_blank">The Tweet</a> which contains the
        twitter image and the messages as well. Although its not much it was
        essentially a really good building block. Not enough to make it operate
        like an actual tweet but the basic idea is there. <br />
        The second attempt in at the me website. but by now it has been changed
        and editted to the self care hub. This contains theformat of a website
        that has hyperlinks. Of course the website is not necessarily long
        enough to contain data that would allow you to be able to jump to top
        from the bottow via the use of a hyperlink but its operational.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          I will add a note here that these websites are not perfect, i dont
          like the colour and the format or the fonts on either websites
          therefore in future the plan is to improve on design. But since we're
          just learning basics for the time being please bear with me</em
