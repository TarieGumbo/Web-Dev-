    <h1>Css Basics</h1>

    <p>
      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing
      the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus
      making our web pages presentable to the users. CSS is designed to make
      style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with
      any XML-based markup language. The three types of CSS include Inline CSS,
      Internal CSS, and External CSS. Inline CSS can be included directly in the
      HTML elements. Internal CSS is the other way of including CSS by using the
      style element in the head section of the HTML document. External CSS
      includes CSS by using an external stylesheet.

        2021 was the year fashion entered the metaverse. As the industry
        embraced virtual worlds, fashion-tech was thrust into the spotlight,
        with new focus on digital clothing and avatars, concepts once considered
        more fringe to major luxury brands. In the metaverse, what we wear and
        how we look is paramount, and a powerful contingent of virtual
        communities is taking shape. “The possibilities that the digital world
        offers to this industry are amazing, almost limitless,” Balmain CMO
        Txampi Diz said at the time of the brands latest NFT launch. This year,
        the brand has launched three NFTs, which are digital assets representing
        real-world objects. “We're going through a major revolution.”
