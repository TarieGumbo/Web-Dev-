      <h2>What is Self Care anyway?</h2>
      <p>
        Self Care is essentially what it sounds like: taking care of yourself.
        Its any activity or practice that's embraced soly for the purpose of
        one's wellbeing. <br />
        <br />
        Self care comes in all forms: making nourishing meals, doing exerciese,
        meitating, spending time in nature, oil pulling or treating oneself to a
        facial. Its not one specific practice but anything is done to nourish
        the body or mind.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do we need to take care of ourselves</h2>
      <p>
        It is very common phenomenon to get caught up in daily life - work,
        kids, relationships, errands and family commitments - that we leave
        little time for ourselves. The mornings are opposite of leisurely as we
        hop in and out of the shower, smudge makeup in the care and wolf down
        breakfast at our desk. <br />
        <br />
        If we are a parent, we so lovingly devote all of our attention to our
        children that we barely have time to wash our hair. Whether we spend the
        day at work or with our kids, it can easily fly by in a flurry of
        meeting deadlines <br />
        <br />Evenings are equally as rushed with just enough time to slap
        dinner together or grab something to go on the way home. There's no real
        transition between the evening's activities and the day's work: brush
        teeth and hit the pillow. Wash, rinse, repeat. <br />
        <br />
        They feel as if there is no time for self-care. But without making an
        effort to care for their wellbeing, they end up feeling worn out,
        lacking energy, and plagued by pesky physical ailments like gas and
        bloating, which are not only uncomfortable but can lead to bigger
        problems. Life feels like a whirlwind. It's easy to lose sight of the
        bigger picture when life is lived without pause.
